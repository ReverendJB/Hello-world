# Hello-world
Trying to figure out this new virtual space in an effort to be literate enough to assist a friend with grant proposals for his projet. 
I am about to turn 49, an aged punk rocker about to graduate community college. I'm interested in professional writing and climate action, and hope to combine the two once I have an undergraduate degree.
